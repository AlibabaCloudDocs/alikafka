# Can I create one more topic for each purchased topic in an instance of the Professional Edition?

The number of topics that you can create in an instance of the Professional Edition is twice the number of topics you purchase.

The number of topics that you can created in an instance of the Professional Edition is twice the number of topics you purchase. For example, if you purchase a Professional Edition instance with 50 topics, the actual number of topics you can create in the instance is 100.
