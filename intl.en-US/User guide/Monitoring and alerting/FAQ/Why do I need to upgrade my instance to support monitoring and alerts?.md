# Why do I need to upgrade my instance to support monitoring and alerts?

You can view and configure the monitoring and alerts feature in the console. However, Message Queue for Apache Kafka instances deployed before November 2018 do not support reporting the monitoring and alerts data. To use the reporting function, you need to upgrade your Message Queue for Apache Kafka instance.

For more information about how to upgrade your Message Queue for Apache Kafka instance, see [Upgrade the instance version](/intl.en-US/User guide/Instances/Upgrade the instance version.md).
