# Can I access a Message Queue for Apache Kafka instance from the Internet?

The commercial edition of Message Queue for Apache Kafka service only supports access from Virtual Private Cloud \(VPC\).

**Note:** You can select the network type only when purchasing the instance and cannot change it after purchase.
