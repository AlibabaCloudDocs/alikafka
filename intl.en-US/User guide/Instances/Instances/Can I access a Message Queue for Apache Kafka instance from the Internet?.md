# Can I access a Message Queue for Apache Kafka instance from the Internet?

Only Message Queue for Apache Kafka instances of the Internet and virtual private cloud \(VPC\) type can be accessed from the Internet.

Message Queue for Apache Kafka only supports instances of the VPC type. Therefore, you cannot access Message Queue for Apache Kafka instances from the Internet.

**Note:** You can select the network type only when you purchase the instance and cannot change it after purchase.
