# Do I have to select the 172.16.0.0/12 CIDR block for the classic network?

No, you do not have to select this CIDR block for the classic network. However, the configuration is the simplest when the 172.16.0.0/12 CIDR block is used.

For more information about other CIDR blocks, see [Overview](/intl.en-US/Network connection/ClassicLink/Overview.md).
