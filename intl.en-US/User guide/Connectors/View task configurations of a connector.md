# View task configurations of a connector

This topic describes how to view the task configurations of a connector in the Message Queue for Apache Kafka console. The configurations include basic information, source instance configurations, and destination instance configurations of the connector.

One of the connectors that are described in the following topics is created:

-   [Create a MaxCompute sink connector](/intl.en-US/User guide/Connectors/Create a connector/Create a MaxCompute sink connector.md)
-   [Create a Function Compute sink connector](/intl.en-US/User guide/Connectors/Create a connector/Create a Function Compute sink connector.md)

1.  Log on to the [Message Queue for Apache Kafka console](https://kafka.console.aliyun.com/?spm=a2c4g.11186623.2.22.6bf72638IfKzDm).

2.  In the top navigation bar, select the region where your instance is located.

3.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Connector**.

4.  On the **Connector** page, select an instance, find the connector whose task configurations you want to view, and then choose **![icon_more](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/6022597161/p185678.png)** \> **View task configuration** in the **Actions** column.
