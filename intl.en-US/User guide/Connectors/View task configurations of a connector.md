This topic describes how to view the task configurations of a connector in the Message Queue for Apache Kafka console. The configurations include basic information, source instance configurations, and destination instance configurations of the connector.

One of the connectors that are described in the following topics is created:

-   [Create a Function Compute sink connector](/intl.en-US/User guide/Connectors/Create a connector/Create a Function Compute sink connector.md)
-   [Create a MaxCompute sink connector](/intl.en-US/User guide/Connectors/Create a connector/Create a MaxCompute sink connector.md)
-   [Create an OSS sink connector](/intl.en-US/User guide/Connectors/Create a connector/Create an OSS sink connector.md)
-   [Create an Elasticsearch sink connector](/intl.en-US/User guide/Connectors/Create a connector/Create an Elasticsearch sink connector.md)
-   [Create a MySQL source connector](/intl.en-US/User guide/Connectors/Create a connector/Create a MySQL source connector.md)

1.  Log on to the [Message Queue for Apache Kafka console](https://kafka.console.aliyun.com/?spm=a2c4g.11186623.2.22.6bf72638IfKzDm).
