# Evaluate specifications

This topic describes how to select an appropriate instance edition for a user-created Kafka cluster that is to be migrated to Alibaba Cloud by using the specification evaluation feature of Message Queue for Apache Kafka.

An Alibaba Cloud account is created and real-name verification is completed. For more information, see [Create your Alibaba Cloud account](https://account.alibabacloud.com/register/intl_register.htm).

## Evaluate specifications

**Note:** The specification evaluation feature of Message Queue for Apache Kafka follows the principle of lowest costs. We recommend Message Queue for Apache Kafka instances with the lowest price, which can meet your normal business needs.

To evaluate the specifications, perform the following steps:

1.  Log on to the [Message Queue for Apache Kafka console](https://kafka.console.aliyun.com/?spm=a2c4g.11186623.2.22.6bf72638IfKzDm).

2.  In the top navigation bar, select a region.

3.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Migration**.

4.  Click the **Evaluation** tab.

5.  In the **Instance Specifications** section, enter the specification information of the user-created Kafka cluster and click **Evaluate**.

    The recommended Message Queue for Apache Kafka instance edition appears in the **Recommended** section.
