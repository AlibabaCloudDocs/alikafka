# What is the consumer group count?

By default, the consumer group count is twice the topic count. For example, if an instance has 50 topics, you can create up to 100 consumer groups in this instance. To increase the number of consumer groups, you can increase the number of topics. The number of consumer groups is increased by two each time a topic is added. For more information, see [Upgrade the instance configuration](/intl.en-US/User guide/Instances/Upgrade the instance configuration.md).
