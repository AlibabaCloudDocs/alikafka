# How do I determine which IP addresses are consuming messages?

You can view the consumption status based on consumer groups in the console.

Log on to the console and view the consumption status based on consumer groups. Click **Details** to view the **owner** of each partition and then the corresponding IP address.

If the **owner** is empty, the consumer is offline or in the **Rebalance** state.
