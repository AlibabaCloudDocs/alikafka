# Why am I charged for extra topics?

-   After an on-premises open-source Apache Kafka cluster contains more than 1,000 partitions, cluster performance begins to drop sharply. In the case where one topic corresponds to 24 partitions, a performance bottleneck occurs when a cluster contains less than 50 topics.
-   Message Queue for Apache Kafka has optimized it to support theoretically unlimited partitions in a single cluster. Therefore, you are charged for extra topics.
