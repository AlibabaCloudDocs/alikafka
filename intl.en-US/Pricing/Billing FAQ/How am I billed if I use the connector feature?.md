# How am I billed if I use the connector feature?

The connector feature of Message Queue for Apache Kafka is in public review. This feature is independent of Message Queue for Apache Kafka instances. Therefore, you are not charged on the Message Queue for Apache Kafka side when you use a connector to synchronize data between Message Queue for Apache Kafka and other Alibaba Cloud services. Alibaba Cloud does not provide any Service Level Agreement \(SLA\) guarantees for the connector feature in public preview. For more information about SLA guarantees and billing of other related services, see descriptions of corresponding services.
