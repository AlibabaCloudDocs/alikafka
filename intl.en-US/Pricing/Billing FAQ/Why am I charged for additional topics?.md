# Why am I charged for additional topics?

Message Queue for Apache Kafka has optimized the performance degradation caused by additional topics.

-   The performance of a user-created open source Apache Kafka cluster deteriorates sharply when the cluster contains more than 1,000 partitions. In normal cases, one topic corresponds to 24 partitions. A performance bottleneck occurs when a cluster contains nearly 50 topics.
-   Message Queue for Apache Kafka has optimized this issue to support theoretically unlimited partitions in a single cluster. Therefore, you are charged for additional topics.
