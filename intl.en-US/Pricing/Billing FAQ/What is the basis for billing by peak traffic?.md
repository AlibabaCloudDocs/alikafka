# What is the basis for billing by peak traffic?

The peak traffic specifies not only the bandwidth but also the processing capability of the entire cluster. For example, if the peak traffic of an instance is 30 MB/s, the instance has a data processing capability of 30 MB/s × 60s × 60 × 24/1024/1024 = 2.4 TB every day.
