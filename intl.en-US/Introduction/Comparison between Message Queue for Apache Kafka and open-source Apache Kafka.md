# Comparison between Message Queue for Apache Kafka and open-source Apache Kafka

This topic compares Message Queue for Apache Kafka and open-source Apache Kafka in terms of stability, kernel capability, and governance capability.

## Stability

|Item|Message Queue for Apache Kafka|Apache Kafka|
|----|------------------------------|------------|
|Disk usage|Deletes old data when no free disk space is available.|Experiences downtime when no free disk space is available.|
|Thread pool isolation|Ensures normal data write when cold data are read.|Experiences thread blocking when cold data are read, which causes frequent data write failures.|
|Partition size|Stably writes data to tens of thousands of partitions.|Experiences frequent jitter when writing data to thousands of partitions.|
|Inspection system|Automatically detects and fixes deadlocks and breakdowns.|None.|
|Bug fixes|Detects and fixes bugs at the earliest opportunity.|Waits for the community to release new versions to fix bugs, which takes a long time.|

## Kernel capabilities

|Item|Message Queue for Apache Kafka|Apache Kafka|
|----|------------------------------|------------|
|Scalability|Supports scaling in seconds. The scaling is not perceived by the upper-layer services.|Supports scaling in hours, which affects clusters due to increased traffic from replication.|
|Storage cost|Provides highly reliable cloud storage in the Professional Edition to save a lot of storage space.|Provides three-replica storage to ensure availability and reliability, which imposes a heavy load on storage.|

## Governance capabilities

|Item|Message Queue for Apache Kafka|Apache Kafka|
|----|------------------------------|------------|
|Version upgrade|Supports one-click upgrade.|Supports manual upgrade, which is prone to errors.|
|Metrics curve|Provides a complete metrics curve to facilitate traffic tracing and troubleshooting.|Provides only real-time metrics. Historical data is difficult to access.|
|Message accumulation alerts|Triggers alerts on message accumulation.|None.|
|Subscription|Provides comprehensive subscriptions.|Provides brief subscriptions.|
|Partition status|Provides a complete partition status diagram.|Provides a brief partition status diagram.|
|Message sending|Allows you to directly send messages from the console.|Allows you to send messages only through the command-line interface, which results in high costs.|
|Message query|Allows you to directly view messages by time or offset in the console.|Allows you to consume messages through the command-line interface, but you cannot view messages by time or offset.|
